# House Price Prediction System  

## Existing systems: 
- Manual Analysis: Real estate agents and buyers rely on manual property valuation, which is prone to errors.
- Spreadsheet-Based Tools: Many agencies use basic spreadsheets, which lack advanced predictive capabilities.
-	Time-Consuming: Manual evaluation is time-intensive and inconsistent. 
## Drawbacks of Existing System: 
-	Human Error: Manual methods lead to inaccurate price predictions.
-	Lack of Scalability: Existing systems cannot handle large datasets efficiently.
-	Inconsistencies: Subjective judgments by different individuals result in variability.

## Introduction of proposed system :    
The House Price Prediction System leverages machine learning to predict property prices based on multiple features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. It includes a web interface built with HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask for user interaction. The system is deployed on AWS EC2, enabling users to input parameters through the website and receive real-time price predictions.
Need of Proposed System :  
This system simplifies property evaluation for buyers, sellers, and agents by offering accurate and consistent predictions. 
It automates calculations, reduces manual errors, and provides scalability for handling large datasets.
## Scope of the proposed System :   
-	Web-Based Platform: Users can access the system on any device with an internet connection.
-	Real-Time Predictions: Get instant property price predictions based on user input.
-	User-Friendly Design: Simplified interfaces for entering property details and viewing predictions.
-	Scalability: Supports multiple users and large datasets.

## Objectives of the Proposed System:  
-	Accurate Predictions: Use machine learning models to provide reliable house price predictions.
-	Automation: Eliminate manual errors through an automated system.
-	Cloud Deployment: Ensure global accessibility through AWS EC2 hosting.
-	Enhanced User Experience: Provide an intuitive interface for smooth interactions.
## Features of Proposed System:  
-	User Input Form: Input parameters like area, bedrooms, location, etc.
-	Real-Time Predictions: Display predicted house prices immediately.
-	Model Training: Use Kaggle datasets for training a regression model.
-	Web Deployment: Flask-based backend with HTML and CSS for the frontend.
